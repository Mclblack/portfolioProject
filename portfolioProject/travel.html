  In 2016 I backpacked through Mexico, Belize and into Guatemala.  This trip had many highlights but one of the best moments was reaching summit
  of a volcano Acatenango.  Acatenango, at the time was inactive but a nearby volcano called volcano Fuego was still, very much so active.  Seeing and
  hearing the activity of a active Volcano was an incredible experience and well worth the gruelling two day hike.

   Recently, I travelled to Colombia and experienced what that country had to offer. The whole experience was wonderful and I particularly liked
   the cities of Cartaenga and Santa Marta.  The photo above was taken in Santa Marta.  The street art was really interesting in Colombia and I wanted
   to capture what it was all about.
